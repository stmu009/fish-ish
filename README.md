#fish-ish
Swim fishy swim!

## Description
‘Fish-ish’ is the perfect game to test your navigation of the seas! Try to help your fish successfully swim from point A to B. But watch out for those under-the-sea obstacles! Players will maneuver the waters via the arrow keys. The value is for our consumer to feel rewarded when playing this game. We want our users to play this when needing a quick break from the hustle and bustle of the day, as a stress reliever, or just a fun way to kill time.
